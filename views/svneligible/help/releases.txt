svneligible releases
	List the contents of ^/releases, in natural sort order.

	If you have configured any 'releases' exclusions in config/svneligible.php,
	then those branches will be pruned from the list before being displayed.

	Note that this filtering also applies to commands using the --stable option
	to get the latest release branch.
