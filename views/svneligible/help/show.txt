svneligible show [<branch>|--stable] [--author=<name>] [--initial=<rev>] [--final=<rev>] [--range=<start>:<stop>]
	Show revisions (and log messages) that are eligible to merge from another branch.

	The operation of the --author, --initial, --final, and --range options, are identical
	to that of the 'merge' command.

	You may either pass a branch in directly, use the --stable option to automatically
	look up the latest release branch (the bottom one returned from the 'releases' command),
	or finally you may use the 'upstreams' feature to set a default branch. If none of these
	options are found, an error occurs.

	Passing --author=<name> will only show revisions committed by the specified author (username).
	This is useful for seeing only commits that you have made.

	If you pass --initial=<rev>, then no revisions prior to <rev> will be shown.

	The --final=<rev> option will stop displaying revisions once <rev> is output.

	Finally, there is a --range=<start>:<stop> option, which allows an inclusive range to be specified
	in a short-hand notation, similar to Subversion's normal merging.

	You cannot pass --range at the same time as --initial or --final, doing so will result in an error.

	Note: Subversion's standard commands expect you to make up the first revision, whereas svneligible accepts
	non-braindead arguments. The options passed to --initial, --final, and --range are all inclusive.
