svneligible diff [<path>|--stable]
	Perform a diff between the currently checked-out branch and another branch.

	You may either pass a branch in directly, use the --stable option to automatically
	look up the latest release branch (the bottom one returned from the 'releases' command),
	or finally you may use the 'upstreams' feature to set a default branch. If none of these
	options are found, an error occurs.
