svneligible stack [<list|remove|clear>] [<id>]
	The stack command allows you to modify the branch stack, as used by the
	'branch' and 'switch' commands.

	Running stack with no parameters (or the 'list' subcommand) simply lists the
	contents of the branch stack.

	The 'remove' subcommand takes a single parameter: the id of the stack item
	to remove, as shown in the output from the 'list' subcommand.

	The 'clear' subcommand simply empties the branch stack.
