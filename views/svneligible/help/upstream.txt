svneligible upstream
svneligible upstream set <upstream> [<alias|path>]
svneligible upstream remove [<alias|path>] [--all]
	Shows or changes the upstream configuration. Upstream branches are those used automatically by the
	'show', 'diff', 'merge', and 'reintegrate' commands when no <path> option is specified.

	Running 'upstream' with no parameters will output all currently-configured upstreams.

	By default, the currently-checked out path is used for the setting (for example, when on a branch,
	you can run 'svneligible upstream set ^/trunk', and the upstream command will infer the current branch
	from your working copy). Passing '<alias|path>' will instead use that path (or alias), allowing you
	to set up branches that are not currently checked out. For example, if you currently have ^/trunk
	checked out, you can set the upstream for a branch using the command
	'svneligible upstream set ^/trunk ^/branches/feature'.

	You may also create arbitrary aliases in the same way, for example
	'svneligible upstream set ^/releases/RB-1.1 oldstable' allows you to compare against an older
	release branch easily by issuing 'svneligible show oldstable' in the working copy.

	The 'remove' subcommand only accepts (optionally) the alias or path:
	'svneligible upstream remove oldstable' will remove the upstream alias 'oldstable', whereas
	'svneligible upstream remove' will delete the upstream for the currently-checked out branch.

	You may also pass the --all option to the remove subcommand, which will remove all
	upstreams in the current working copy.
