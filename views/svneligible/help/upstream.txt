svneligible upstream [<upstream>|--remove] [--path=<path>]
	Shows or changes the upstream configuration. Upstream branches are those used automatically by the
	'show', 'diff', 'merge', and 'reintegrate' commands when no <path> option is specified.

	Running 'upstream' with no parameters will output all currently-configured upstream branches.

	By default, the currently-checked out path is used for the setting (for example, when on a branch,
	you can run 'svneligible upstream ^/trunk', and the upstream command will infer the current branch
	from your working copy). Passing '--path=<path>' will instead use that path, allowing you to set up
	branches that are not currently checked out. For example, if you currently have ^/trunk checked out,
	you can set the upstream for a branch using the command
	'svneligible upstream ^/trunk --path=^/branches/feature'.

	The --remove option will remove any upstream setting for the currently checked-out branch (or you may
	specify a different branch using the --path option).
