svneligible createrelease [--no-commit]
	Creates a new release branch by attempting to guess the next release number.

	This command will always branch from your currently checked-out path, so if
	you want your branch to be created from trunk, make sure that's where you're working!

	By default, it will automatically commit using a message like "Creating new release
	branch ^/releases/RB-1.1", you can disable this by using --no-commit.
