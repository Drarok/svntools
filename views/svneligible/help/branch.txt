svneligible branch <existing_path> <new_path> [--parents] [--no-switch] [--commit=<message>]
	Create a new branch in the repository, and configure the upstream automatically.

	Passing the --parents option will tell Subversion to create the parent direcories automatically.

	This command will automatically switch your working copy unless you pass --no-switch.

	You may also specify a commit message on the command line instead of using your editor,
	using '--commit=<message>'. You will need to surround your commit message with quotes.
