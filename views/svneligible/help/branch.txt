svneligible branch [<existing_path>] <new_path> [--parents] [--no-switch] [--commit=<message>]
	Create a new branch in the repository, and configure the upstream automatically.

	Given two paths, the first is the path to branch from, and the second is that path
	where the branch should be created. Given a single parameter, that path will be taken
	to be the path where the branch will be created, and the currently-checked out branch
	will be used as the source.

	Passing the --parents option will tell Subversion to create the parent directories automatically.

	Also note that there is a "quick branch" feature. If you don't pass a branch name beginning with
	"^/", then your configured quick branch prefix is prepended to the <new_path> option, and --parents
	is implied.

	This command will automatically switch your working copy unless you pass --no-switch.

	You may also specify a commit message on the command line instead of using your editor,
	using '--commit=<message>'. You will need to surround your commit message with quotes.
