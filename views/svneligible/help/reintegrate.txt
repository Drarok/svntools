svneligible reintegrate [<path>] [--commit[=<message>] [--remove]]
	Perform a reintegration merge by switching the working copy, merging, optionally committing,
	and optionally automatically removing the now-integrated branch.

	You may either pass a branch in directly, use the --stable option to automatically
	look up the latest release branch (the bottom one returned from the 'releases' command),
	or finally you may use the 'upstreams' feature to set a default branch. If none of these
	options are found, an error occurs.

	Passing '--commit' will show your editor, allowing you to enter a commit message,
	or you can specify it directly on the command line using the format '--commit=<message>'.
	Note that you will need to wrap your commit message in quotes.

	If you pass '--remove' in addition to '--commit[=<message>]', then the reintegrated branch
	will automatically be removed. The --remove option has no effect if --commit is not passed.
