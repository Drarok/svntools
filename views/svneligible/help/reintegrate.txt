svneligible reintegrate [<path>|--stable] [--no-commit|--commit[=<message>] [--no-remove]
	Perform a reintegration merge by switching the working copy, merging, committing,
	and automatically removing the now-integrated branch.

	You may either pass a branch path in directly, use the --stable option to automatically
	look up the latest release branch (the bottom one returned from the 'releases' command),
	or finally you may use the 'upstreams' feature to set a default branch. If none of these
	options are found, an error occurs.

	You may pass the '--no-commit' option to stop the process once a merge has occurred, but
	prior to a commit. This allows you to manually inspect the merge result before committing.

	Your editor will be shown for a commit message to be entered, or you can specify a commit
	message on the command line by passing '--commit=<message>'.
	Note that you will need to wrap your commit message in quotes if you use the command line.

	If the commit is successful, then the branch will be automatically removed, unless you
	specify the '--no-remove' option. If the commit isn't attempted due to '--no-commit', then
	the branch is not removed.
